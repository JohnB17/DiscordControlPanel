# DiscordControlPanel
A Control Panel For Discord

This is just a proof of concept, Will be improved by a order of magnitude.
Now includes support for the web application

============================================================================================

As I can't work out the bug that it is detected by an antivirus becuase of how I have to close Discord, development will cease until I can put in the time to learn how to actually write the code instead of just converting batch files to exe, the real source code (the batch files) will be uploaded.
